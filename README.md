# Poly-to-Points
 A script that extracts all points from a feature layer from a gbd and then saves the individual polygon shapes as a text file with different names.

 It usees arcpy library and especially the arcpy.da and cursors to navigate through each point and basic File I/O to save the coordinates of the path of the Polygons as [Latitude, Latitude]
